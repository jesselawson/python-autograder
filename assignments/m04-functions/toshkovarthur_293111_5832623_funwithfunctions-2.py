Module 04 Assignment: "Fun with Functions"

OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This file contains six programming problems that involve writing functions 
from scratch. 

Remember that you have to copy and paste this assignment into a file on your
local machine, save that file as "funwithfunctions.py", then upload that file 
to the Canvas assignment. 

DIRECTIONS
================================================================================

Each of the six Problems you are expected to finish have specifications ("specs")
inside a code block, followed by a placeholder block of code where I want you 
to write the function that satisfies the specs. This is exactly how the mid-term 
and final examinations will take place--big files like this with a problem 
written in comments and then a section immediately after where you are to 
write your answer--in the form of code, of course.

Follow the directions, paying close attention to what is being asked, the 
logical conditions, and the expected outcomes. Each Problem requires you to 
write a separate function specific to that problem. 

I have provided an example called "Problem 0".

When you are finished, upload the complete file on the Canvas assignment page.

"""

"""
Problem 0
Write a function called "hello_world".
It should take one string argument, "name".
It should print "Hello {name}, and hello world!"
"""

def hello_world(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}, and hello world!")

"""
Problem 1
Write a function called "string_compare".
It should take two string arguments.
It should return True if both strings are equal.
It should return False if both strings are not equal.
"""

def string_compare(compare_first, compare_second):
    if compare_first == compare_second:
        return True
    elif compare_first != compare_second:
        return False
        
#compares string argument using == (equal to) and != (not equal to) printing a different result depending on outcome.

""" 
Problem 2
Write a function called "string_append".
It should take two string arguments.
It should return a new string equal to the contents of the first argument
and the contents of the second argument. 
"""

def string_append(append_first, append_second):
    return append_first + append_second

#appends both string arguments without a space

"""
Problem 3
Write a function called "first_five_letters".
It should take one string argument. 
It should return the first five letters of the string argument. 
"""

def first_five_letters(first_five):
    return first_five[:5]

#returns first five letters of string. [0:5] also works

"""
Problem 4
Write a function called "calculate_shipping_costs".

It should take two integer arguments, "total_packages" and "total_weight".

It should return the product of "total_packages" and 12.50
when "total_weight" is less than 50. 

It should return the product of "total_packages" and 19.75
when "total_weight" is 50 or more. 
"""

def calculate_shipping_costs(total_packages, total_weight):
    if total_weight < 50:
        return 12.50*total_packages
    elif total_weight >= 50:
        return 19.75*total_packages

#calculates shipping costs depending on number of packages and total weight of packages using if/elif statements.

"""
Problem 5
Write a function called "favorite_color".
It should take one string argument, "name".
It should return "Blue" when "name" is "Jack" or "Michelle".
It should return "Green" when "name" is "Robert".
It should return "Purple" when "name" is "Jesse".
It should return "Seafoam" when "name" is "Sami".
It should return "Black" in any other case.
"""

def favorite_color(name):
    if name == "Jack" or name == "Michelle":
        return "Blue"
    elif name == "Robert":
        return "Green"
    elif name == "Jesse":
        return "Purple"
    elif name == "Sami":
        return "Seafoam"
    else:
        return "Black"

#prints favorite color depending on name using if/elif statements.

"""
Problem 6
Write a function called "is_spam".
It should take one string argument, "subject".
It should return True if any of the following are true:
    * "subject" contains the string "Greeting , " 
    * "subject" contains the string "Re: Fwd: Coupons"
    * "subject" contains the string "Special Offer !"
(pay attention to special characters and spaces in this one!)

"""

def is_spam(subject):
    if subject.find("Greeting , ") == 0 or subject.find("Re: Fwd: Coupons") == 0 or subject.find("Special Offer !") == 0:
        return True

#Searches string argument for specific strings and returns true if subject.find == 0 (if the string is found)
