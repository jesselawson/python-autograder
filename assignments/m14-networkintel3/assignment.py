Repl.it Link: 



OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The NSA's Basic Overview Operations & Planning (BOOP) division has been 
experiencing a high-volume of suspicious network activity from inside the 
intranet. The NSA's intranet is a closed-off, firewalled internal 
communications network among workstations in and around several buildings in 
Quantico, VA, connecting them to classified servers throughout Virginia and the 
D.C. area. 

SITUATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have been brought in to the NSA to help parse through traffic logs of 
one particularly important system to find out which computers on the internal 
net are responsible for the suspicious activity. 

MISSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use what you've learned about object-oriented programming in Python to 
construct a log parser that will find IP addresses of workstations on the NSA's
intranet that have "login_failed" comprising > 35% of all activity for that IP.

TIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use the class Discord server to work with your classmates through any issues 
or concerns you may have. Your professor will be there also to help guide 
discussions and provide support.
